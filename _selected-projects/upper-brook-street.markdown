Hexagon Construction were commissioned to carry out extensive remodelling and refurbishment of this central London apartment.

The layout of the apartment was reconfigured to provide new bathrooms, en suite and kitchen facilities.

Bespoke fitted cabinetry with integrated lighting was installed and custom made doors and architraves were fabricated for the project.
