The top two floors of this Hampstead townhouse were extensively remodelled and refurbished to create a generous two bedroom maisonette.

Internal partitions were removed from the top floor to create a contemporary open plan space with triple aspect views across London. Kitchen, dining and living spaces are denoted by an island counter, a roof light to passively ventilate the deep plan and a bespoke pre-cast concrete fireplace as a focal point.

On the lower floor more traditional detailing was used and original features were restored. Internal partitions were re-organised to create a generous entrance hall and well rationalised plan.

Floor structures were levelled and strengthened throughout to feel sturdy and robust under foot and the environmental performance of the property was improved by insulating the roof and external walls of the top floor.
