The Pryors is an Edwardian mansion block that is situated in the heart of Hampstead, adjacent to the heath. Hexagon Construction were appointed to carry out a full internal refurbishment of an appartment in this block.

The living and dining areas were connected to the bedrooms via the hallway through an expansive parquet floor finish. This balanced the clean lines of the kitchen design with the heritage of the marble fireplace and cast iron radiators. The existing floor plan was completely updated with new finishes, new period detailing and bespoke cabinetry to create a bright, functional and welcoming home for its residents.
