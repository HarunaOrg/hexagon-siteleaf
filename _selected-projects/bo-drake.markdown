Hexagon Construction recently completed works on this stylish commercial project in Soho.

The restaurant was completely remodeled and refurbished to create a contemporary atmospheric dining experience.

Fronted with an individually crafted timber shop front in black with reeded glass panels provides an industrial take on the traditional style, giving the restaurant a striking first impression.

Inside you are welcomed by warm pendant lighting above a hand crafted bespoke bar made out of 8 meters of solid steel and iroko.

Various crafted shelving and cabinetry adds softer detailing in contrast to the industrial gleaming metal ducting above bare brick walls that snakes throughout snug the dining area.
