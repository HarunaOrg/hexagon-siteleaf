A 115 sqm derelict warehouse in Hackney dating from around 1890 converted to an open-plan two bedroom house with an industrial aesthetic.

Working with [Paper House Project](https://www.paperhouseproject.co.uk/), Hexagon installed the complex structural interventions to open up the space and add light and height to create a practical, modern space. Bespoke extended leg steel trusses and cable rod supports were installed to support the new slate roof and a high-level perimeter ring beam with concrete corner bonders holds the original brick envelope together, whilst allowing large new window openings to be formed.

The project has been shortlisted for the RICS Awards 2017 and featured in [Grand Designs Magazine](http:///www.hexagonconstruction.com/uploads/058_GDS_0617.pdf).
